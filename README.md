# KodeGo Assignments & Activities

âœ¨Hello! World? ^v^

Just kidding! 

It's my pleasure having you in this repo.

I compiled the clean files from my local com (if you know what I mean ðŸ¤¦), just to impress you. 

As of now, it's all about basic Javascript activities and assignments.

Wherein:

âœ… I got to try making mini-website of my computations. 
See the https://js-basic-function-byems.netlify.app/
âœ… I managed to use arithmetic, conditional, comparison, and logical operators.
See the https://github.com/designwithems/Javascript_Assignment.github.io/tree/main/JS_Conditions_Activity  
âœ…I managed to create a simple home page.
See the https://kyuri-ryouri-restaurant.netlify.app/
âœ…I created a mini-calculator.
See the https://mini-calculator000.netlify.app/
ðŸŽ‰I hope as a newbie I'll keep you interested even in the future, please come visit againðŸŽ‰
